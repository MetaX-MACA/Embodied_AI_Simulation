        "\nYour goal is to set the  joint angles of some articulated objects to the right value in the initial state, given a task. The task is for a robot arm to learn the corresponding skills to manipulate the articulated object. \n\nThe input to you will include the task name, a short description of the task, the articulation tree of the articulated object, a semantic file of the articulated object, the bodies and joints of the articulated objects that will be involved in the task, and the substeps for doing the task. \n\nYou should output for each joint involved in the task, what joint value it should be set to. You should output a number with 0 or 1, where 0 corresponds to the lower limit of that joint angle, and 1 corresponds to the upper limit of the joint angle. \n\nBy default, the joints in an object are set to their lower joint limits. You can assume that the lower joint limit corresponds to the natural state of the articulated object. E.g., for a door's hinge joint, 0 means it is closed, and 1 means it is open.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nInput:\nTask Name: Close the microwave door\nDescription: The robotic arm will close the microwave door after put the mug in it.\n\n```slidecabinet articulation tree:\nbodies:\nslide\nslidedoor\n\njoints: \njoint_name: slidedoor_joint joint_type: slide parent_body: slide child_body: slidedoor\n```\n\n```slidecabinet semantics\nslide heavy slidecabinet_body\nslidedoor slide door\n```\n\n```Mug articulation tree:\nbodies:\nmug_base\n\njoints: \nNone\n```\n\n```Mug semantics\nmug_base heavy mug_body\n```\n\n```Microwave articulation tree:\nbodies:\nmicroroot\nmicrodoorroot\nmicro_timer_knob\nmicro_temperature_knob\n\njoints: \njoint_name: microdoorroot_joint joint_type: hinge parent_body: microroot child_body: microdoorroot\njoint_name: micro_timer_joint joint_type: hinge parent_body: microroot child_body: micro_timer_knob\njoint_name: micro_temperature_joint joint_type: hinge parent_body: microroot child_body: micro_temperature_knob\n```\n\n```Microwave semantics\nmicroroot heavy microwave_body\nmicrodoorroot hinge door\nmicro_timer_knob hinge timer_knob\nmicro_temperature_knob hinge temperature_knob\n```\n\nBodies:\n- microdoorroot: from the semantics, this is the door of the microwave.

The robot needs to first move into the sliding cabinet, the slide door should be initially opened, its value should be 1, which corresponds to the upper joint limit. Then the robot need to put the item into microwave, so the microwave door also need to be initially opened, its value should be 1, which corresponds to the upper joint limit. Finally, the robot need to rotate the temperature knob, it should be off. Therefore, micro_temperature_joint should be set to its value to 0, which corresponds to the lower joint limit.\n\n```joint value\nslidedoor_joint: 1\nmicrodoorroot_joint: 1\nmicro_temperature_joint: 0\n```\n\n\nOne more example:\nTask Name: Open Slide Cabinet Door\nDescription:  The robotic arm will open the slide cabinet door\n\n```slidecabinet articulation tree:\nbodies:\nslide\nslidedoor\n\njoints: \njoint_name: slidedoor_joint joint_type: slide parent_body: slide child_body: slidedoor\n```\n\n```slidecabinet semantics\nslide heavy slidecabinet_body\nslidedoor slide door\n```\n\n```Mug articulation tree:\nbodies:\nmug_base\n\njoints: \nNone\n```\n\n```Mug semantics\nmug_base heavy mug_body\n```\n\n```Microwave articulation tree:\nbodies:\nmicroroot\nmicrodoorroot\nmicro_timer_knob\nmicro_temperature_knob\n\njoints: \njoint_name: microdoorroot_joint joint_type: hinge parent_body: microroot child_body: microdoorroot\njoint_name: micro_timer_joint joint_type: hinge parent_body: microroot child_body: micro_timer_knob\njoint_name: micro_temperature_joint joint_type: hinge parent_body: microroot child_body: micro_temperature_knob\n```\n\n```Microwave semantics\nmicroroot heavy microwave_body\nmicrodoorroot hinge door\nmicro_timer_knob hinge timer_knob\nmicro_temperature_knob hinge temperature_knob\n```\n\nBodies:\n- slidedoor: from the semantics, this is the door of the microwave. The robot needs to approach this door in order to open it.\n\nJoints:\n- slidedoor_joint: from the articulation tree, this is the hinge joint that connects microdoorroot (the door). Therefore, the robot needs to actuate this joint for opening the door.\n\nsubsteps:\nmove to the slide cabinet door\ngrasp the slide cabinet door\nopen the slide cabinet door\nrelease the slide cabinet door\n\nOutput:\nThe goal is for the robot arm to learn to open the slide cabinet door. Therefore, the door needs to be initially closed, thus, we are setting its value to 0, which corresponds to the lower joint limit. \n```joint values\nslidedoor_joint: 0\n```\n\nNote that, If the substeps include taking an object out of Container A and placing it into Container B or on table, **it can be assumed that the doors of A and B are already open**, allowing the robotic arm to directly grasp the object and place it into B. For example, if moving a mug from the sliding cabinet to the microwave, the robot arm can directly grasp the mug and place it into microwave, and close microwave door. Therefore, both the sliding cabinet door and the microwave door joint should be set to 1, which corresponds to the upper joint limit.\n\nCan you do it for the following task:\n\nTask name: Open Microwave Door\nDescription: The robotic arm will open the microwave door\n\n\n\n```microwave articulation tree \nbodies:\nmicroroot\nmicrodoorroot\nmicro_timer_knob\nmicro_temperature_knob\n\njoints: \njoint_name: microdoorroot_joint joint_type: hinge parent_body: microroot child_body: microdoorroot\njoint_name: micro_timer_joint joint_type: hinge parent_body: microroot child_body: micro_timer_knob\njoint_name: micro_temperature_joint joint_type: hinge parent_body: microroot child_body: micro_temperature_knob \n```\n\n```microwave semantics \nmicroroot heavy microwave_body\nmicrodoorroot hinge door\nmicro_timer_knob hinge timer_knob\nmicro_temperature_knob hinge temperature_knob \n```\n\n```slidecabinet articulation tree \nbodies:\nslide\nslidedoor\n\njoints: \njoint_name: slidedoor_joint joint_type: slide parent_body: slide child_body: slidedoor \n```\n\n```slidecabinet semantics \nslide heavy slidecabinet_body\nslidedoor slide door \n```\n\n```mug articulation tree \nbodies:\nmug_base\n\n\njoints: \nNone \n```\n\n```mug semantics \nmug_base heavy mug_body \n```\n\nBodies:\n microdoorroot: from the semantics, this is the door of the microwave.

        "\nI will give you one or several articulated objectes, with their's articulation tree and semantics. Your goal is to imagine some tasks that a robotic arm can perform with these articulated objectes in kitchen scenarios. You can think of the robotic arm as a Franka Panda robot. The task will be built in a simulator for the robot to learn it. \n\nFocus on manipulation or interaction with the object itself. Sometimes the object will have functions, e.g., a microwave can be used to heat food, in these cases, only mug can bu used to contain food that is needed for the task. \nPlease do not think of tasks that try to assemble or disassemble the object. Do not think of tasks that aim to clean the object or check its functionality.\nPlease do not think of tasks that bodies or joints are not in its articulation tree. Do not think of tasks that may move the object itself.\n\nFor each task you imagined, please write in the following format: \nTask name: the name of the task.\nDescription: some basic descriptions of the tasks. \nAdditional Objects: Additional objects other than the provided articulated objectes required for completing the task. If mug in articulated objectes, this value should be None.\nBodies: Bodies of the articulated objects that are required to perform the task. \n- Body 1: reasons why this body is needed for the task\n- Body 2: reasons why this body is needed for the task\n- …\nJoints: Joints of the articulated objects that are required to perform the task. \n- Joint 1: reasons why this joint is needed for the task\n- Joint 2: reasons why this joint is needed for the task\n- …\n\n\nExample Input: \n\n```Oven articulation tree\nbodies: \nbase\nbody_0\nbody_1\nbody_2\nbody_3\nbody_4\nbody_5\nbody_6\nbody_7\n\njoints: \njoint_name: joint_0 joint_type: hinge parent_body: body_7 child_body: body_0\njoint_name: joint_1 joint_type: hinge parent_body: body_7 child_body: body_1\njoint_name: joint_2 joint_type: hinge parent_body: body_7 child_body: body_2\njoint_name: joint_3 joint_type: hinge parent_body: body_7 child_body: body_3\njoint_name: joint_4 joint_type: hinge parent_body: body_7 child_body: body_4\njoint_name: joint_5 joint_type: hinge parent_body: body_7 child_body: body_5\njoint_name: joint_6 joint_type: hinge parent_body: body_7 child_body: body_6\njoint_name: joint_7 joint_type: none parent_body: base child_body: body_7\n```\n\n```Oven semantics\nbody_0 hinge door\nbody_1 hinge knob\nbody_2 hinge knob\nbody_3 hinge knob\nbody_4 hinge knob\nbody_5 hinge knob\nbody_6 hinge knob\nbody_7 heavy oven_body\n```\n\nExample output:\n\nTask Name: Open Oven Door\nDescription: The robotic arm will open the oven door.\nAdditional Objects: None\nBodies:\n- body_0: from the semantics, this is the door of the oven. The robot needs to approach this door in order to open it. \nJoints: \n- joint_0: from the articulation tree, this is the hinge joint that connects body_0. Therefore, the robot needs to actuate this joint for opening the door.\n\n\nTask Name: Adjust Oven Temperature\nDescription: The robotic arm will turn one of the oven's hinge knobs to set a desired temperature.\nAdditional Objects: None\nBodies:\n- body_1: the robot needs to approach body_1, which is assumed to be the temperature knob, to rotate it to set the temperature.\nJoints:\n- joint_1: joint_1 connects body_1 from the articulation tree. The robot needs to actuate it to rotate body_1 to the desired temperature.\n\n\nTask Name: Heat food Inside Oven \nDescription: The robot arm places a mug inside the oven, and sets the oven temperature to be appropriate for heating the food.\nAdditional Objects: mug\nBodies:\n- body_1: the robot needs to approach body_1, which is the temperature knob, to rotate it to set the desired temperature.\nJoints:\n- joint_1: from the articulation tree, joint_1 connects body_1, which is the temperature knob. The robot needs to actuate it to rotate body_1 to the desired temperature.\n\nTask Name: Set Oven Timer\nDescription: The robot arm turns a timer knob to set cooking time for the food.\nAdditional Objects: None.\nBodies: \n- body_2: body_2 is assumed to be the knob for controlling the cooking time. The robot needs to approach body_2 to set the cooking time.\nJoints:\n- joint_2: from the articulation tree, joint_2 connects body_2. The robot needs to actuate joint_2 to rotate body_2 to the desired position, setting the oven timer.\n\nNote that, If the task include taking an object out of Container A or placing an object into Container B **it can be assumed that the doors of A and B are already open**, allowing the robotic arm to directly grasp the object, you do not need to open it. For example, if moving a mug from the sliding cabinet, or put mug into the microwave, both the sliding cabinet door and the microwave door are already open.\n\nCan you do the same for the following objectes:\n\n```microwave articulation tree \nbodies:\nmicroroot\nmicrodoorroot\nmicro_timer_knob\nmicro_temperature_knob\n\njoints: \njoint_name: microdoorroot_joint joint_type: hinge parent_body: microroot child_body: microdoorroot\njoint_name: micro_timer_joint joint_type: hinge parent_body: microroot child_body: micro_timer_knob\njoint_name: micro_temperature_joint joint_type: hinge parent_body: microroot child_body: micro_temperature_knob \n```\n\n```microwave semantics \nmicroroot heavy microwave_body\nmicrodoorroot hinge door\nmicro_timer_knob hinge timer_knob\nmicro_temperature_knob hinge temperature_knob \n```\n\n```slidecabinet articulation tree \nbodies:\nslide\nslidedoor\n\njoints: \njoint_name: slidedoor_joint joint_type: slide parent_body: slide child_body: slidedoor \n```\n\n```slidecabinet semantics \nslide heavy slidecabinet_body\nslidedoor slide door \n```\n\n```mug articulation tree \nbodies:\nmug_base\n\n\njoints: \nNone \n```\n\n```mug semantics \nmug_base heavy mug_body \n```\n\nThe mug is already placed in the slidecabinet. Please do not generate the task: 'Place the mug into the slide cabinet'.\n"

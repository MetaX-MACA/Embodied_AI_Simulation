        "\nA robotic arm is trying to solve some household object manipulation tasks to learn corresponding skills in a simulator.\n\nWe will provide with you the task description, the initial scene configurations of the task, which contains the objects in the task and certain information about them. \nYour goal is to decompose the task into executable sub-steps for the robot, and for each substep, you should either call a primitive action that the robot can execute, or design a reward function for the robot to learn, to complete the substep. \n\nCommon substeps include moving towards a location, grasping an object, and interacting with the joint of an articulated object.\n\nAn example task:\nTask Name: Adjust Microwave Temperature\nDescription: The robotic arm will turn the microwaves temperature knob to set a desired temperature\nInitial config:\n```yaml\n-   use_table: true\n-   center: (0.8, 0.0, 1.6)\n    lang: a common microwave\n    movable: false\n    name: microwave\n    type: xml\n```\n\nI will also give you the articulation tree and semantics file of the articulated object in the task. Such information will be useful for writing the reward function/the primitive actions, for example, when the reward requires accessing the joint value of a joint in the articulated object, or the position of a body in the articulated object, or when the primitive needs to access a name of the object.\n```Microwave articulation tree:\nbodies:\nmicroroot\nmicrodoorroot\nmicro_timer_knob\nmicro_temperature_knob\n\njoints: \njoint_name: microdoorroot_joint joint_type: hinge parent_body: microroot child_body: microdoorroot\njoint_name: micro_timer_joint joint_type: hinge parent_body: microroot child_body: micro_timer_knob\njoint_name: micro_temperature_joint joint_type: hinge parent_body: microroot child_body: micro_temperature_knob\n```\n\n```Microwave semantics\nmicroroot heavy microwave_body\nmicrodoorroot hinge door\nmicro_timer_knob hinge timer_knob\nmicro_temperature_knob hinge temperature_knob\n```\n\nI will also give you the bodies and joints of the articulated object that will be used for completing the task:\nBodies:\n- micro_temperature_knob: We know from the semantics that micro_temperature_knob is a hinge knob. It is assumed to be the knob that controls the temperature of the microwave. The robot needs to actuate this knob to set the temperature of the microwave.\n\nJoints:\n- micro_temperature_joint: from the articulation tree, micro_temperature_joint connects micro_temperature_knob and is a hinge joint. Therefore, the robot needs to actuate micro_temperature_joint to turn micro_temperature_knob, which is the knob.\n\n\nFor each substep, you should decide whether the substep can be achieved by using the provided list of primitives. If not, you should then write a reward function for the robot to learn to perform this substep. \nIf you choose to write a reward function for the substep, you should also specify the action space of the robot when learning this reward function. \nThere are 2 options for the action space: \"delta-translation\", where the action is the delta translation of the robot end-effector, suited for local movements; and \"normalized-direct-translation\", where the action specifies the target location the robot should move to, suited for moving to a target location.\n\nHere is a list of primitives the robot can do. The robot is equipped with a suction gripper, which makes it easy for the robot to grasp an object. \n- grasp_object_trajectories(env): the robot arm will apply force to its end effector to grasp an object. \n- release_grasp_trajectories(env): the robot arm will release the grasped object. \n- approach_object_trajectories(env, waypoint_func_name): the robot arm will move to the target position following the waypoints provided by the waypoint_func_name. \nNote that all primitives will return a trajectory list which represents the motion trajectory for performing that action. \n\nThe waypoint_func_name represents a function that produces a sequence of 'waypoints', defining the robot arm's trajectory through space. \nHere is a list of available waypoint_func functions that the approach_object_trajectories can use. You are required to select the appropriate waypoint_func based on its functionality and the specific details of the substep. Note that your selection must be limited to the functions within this list.\n- move_to_mug_in_slidecabinet: generate waypoints to move the robot arm end effector near the mug which inside the sliding cabinet.\n- put_mug_in_microwave: generate waypoints for the robot arm end effector to put the mug into the microwave. Use this function to place the mug into the microwave regardless of whether the mug is in the slidecabinet or on the table. For example, if the mug is in the slidecabinet, you can directly use this function to put mug into microwave.\n- move_to_slidecabinet_handle: generate waypoints to move the robot arm end effector near the sliding cabinet door handle.\n- move_to_microwave_handle: generate waypoints to move the robot arm end effector near the microwave door handle.\n- move_to_microwave_timer_knob: generate waypoints to move the robot arm end effector near the microwave timer knob.\n- move_to_microwave_temperature_knob: generate waypoints to move the robot arm end effector near the microwave temperature knob.\n- retrieve_the_mug_from_slidecabinet: generate waypoints to retrieve the mug from slidecabinet and put it on the table.\n\nHere is a list of available robot arm end effector closure degrees.It is used to determine the closure degree of the end effector when the robotic arm executes above primitives.\n- 0.0: End effector closure for robotic arm simple motions or when releasing an object.\n- 0.38: End effector closure for robotic arm when grasping a big object (like a mug) or carrying big object (like a mug) while moving.\n- 0.8: End effector closure for robotic arm when grasping a small object (like door handle or knob).\n\nYou should decide the primitive function name, waypoint_func_name and pinch_grasp, return the result in the following format:\n```primitive\n- primitive_func_name: some_primitive_function\n- waypoint_func_name: some_waypoint_function or None\n- gripper_closure: some_closure_degrees\n```\n\nHere is a list of helper functions that you can use for designing the reward function or the success condition:\n- get_site_position(env_data, site_name): get the position of center of mass of object with site_name. Currently, site_name supports 'slidehandle_site', 'microhandle_site', 'micro_timer_knob_site' and 'micro_temperature_knob_site'. 'slidehandle_site' represents the center point of the sliding cabinet door handle. 'microhandle_site' represents the center point of the microwave door handle. 'micro_timer_knob_site' represents the center point of the microwave timer knob. 'micro_temperature_knob_site' represents the center point of the microwave temperature knob.Please choose the appropriate site_name based on the substep description.\n- get_joint_state(env_data, joint_name): get the joint angle value of a joint in an object.\n- get_joint_limit(env_model, joint_name): get the lower and upper joint angle limit of a joint in an object, returned as a 2-element tuple.\n- get_eef_pos_and_quat(env_data): returns the position, orientation of the robot end-effector as a 2-element tuple.\n\nYou can assume that for objects, the joint value: 0 corresponds to their natural state, e.g., a box is closed with the lid joint being 0, and a lever is unpushed when the joint angle is 0.\n\nFor the above task \"Adjust Microwave Temperature\", it can be decomposed into the following substeps, primitives, and reward functions:\n\nsubstep 1: move to the microwave temperature knob\n```primitive\n- primitive_func_name:  approach_object_trajectories\n- waypoint_func_name: move_to_microwave_temperature_knob\n- gripper_closure: 0.0 # chose 0.0 for simple motions\n```\n\nsubstep 2: grasp the microwave temperature knob\n```primitive\n- primitive_func_name:  grasp_object_trajectories\n- waypoint_func_name: None\n- gripper_closure: 0.8 # chose 0.8 for grasping a small object (like door handle or knob)\n```\n\nsubstep 3: rotate the microwave temperature knob\n```reward\ndef compute_reward(env):\n    # this reward encourages the end-effector to stay near knob to grasp it.\n    eef_pos, eef_quat = get_eef_pos_and_quat(env._data)\n    knob_pos = get_site_position(env._data, 'micro_temperature_knob_site')\n    reward_near = np.linalg.norm(eef_pos - door_pos)\n\n    # Get the joint state of the knob.

Reply yes if you understand the goal.\n\nNote that, If the decomposed sub-steps include taking an object out of Container A and placing it into Container B or on table, **it can be assumed that the doors of A and B are already open**, allowing the robotic arm to directly grasp the object and place it into B, and close the door of B. For example, if moving a mug from the sliding cabinet to the microwave, the robot arm candirectly grasp the mug and place it into microwave, and close microwave door. The correct sequence of sub-steps is as follows:\n```\nsubstep 1: move to the mug inside the sliding cabinet\nsubstep 2: grasp the mug\nsubstep 3: put the mug into microwave\nsubstep 4: release the mug\nsubstep 5: move to the microwave door\nsubstep 6: grasp the microwave door\nsubstep 7: close the microwave door\nsubstep 8: release the microwave door\n```\n",

Therefore, the robot needs to actuate this joint for closing the door.\n\nThis task can be decomposed as follows:\n\nsubstep 1: move to the microwave door\n```primitive\n- primitive_func_name:  approach_object_trajectories\n- waypoint_func_name: move_to_microwave_handle\n- gripper_closure: 0.0 # chose 0.0 for releasing an object\n```\n\nsubstep 2: grasp the microwave door\n```primitive\n- primitive_func_name:  grasp_object_trajectories\n- waypoint_func_name: None\n- gripper_closure: 0.8 # chose 0.8 for grasping a small object (like door handle or knob)\n```\n\nsubstep 3: close the microwave door\n```reward\ndef compute_reward(env):\n    # This reward encourages the end-effector to stay near door to grasp it.\n    eef_pos, eef_quat = get_eef_pos_and_quat(env._data)\n    door_pos = get_site_position(env._data, 'microhandle_site')\n    reward_near = np.linalg.norm(eef_pos - door_pos)\n\n    # Get the joint state of the door.

For each substep, write a primitive yaml config or a reward function, and the action space if the reward is used. \n\nThe primitives you can call:\n- grasp_object_trajectories(env): the robot arm will apply force to its end effector to grasp an object. \n- release_grasp_trajectories(env): the robot arm will release the grasped object. \n- approach_object_trajectories(env, waypoint_func_name): the robot arm will move to the target position following the waypoints provided by the waypoint_func_name. \nNote that all primitives will return a trajectory list which represents the motion trajectory for performing that action. \n\nThe waypoint_func_name represents a function that produces a sequence of 'waypoints', defining the robot arm's trajectory through space. \nHere is a list of available waypoint_func functions that the approach_object_trajectories can use. You are required to select the appropriate waypoint_func based on its functionality and the specific details of the substep. Note that your selection must be limited to the functions within this list.\n- move_to_mug_in_slidecabinet: generate waypoints to move the robot arm end effector near the mug which inside the sliding cabinet.\n- put_mug_in_microwave: generate waypoints for the robot arm end effector to put the mug into the microwave. Use this function to place the mug into the microwave regardless of whether the mug is in the slidecabinet or on the table. For example, if the mug is in the slidecabinet, you can directly use this function to put mug into microwave.\n- move_to_slidecabinet_handle: generate waypoints to move the robot arm end effector near the sliding cabinet door handle.\n- move_to_microwave_handle: generate waypoints to move the robot arm end effector near the microwave door handle.\n- move_to_microwave_timer_knob: generate waypoints to move the robot arm end effector near the microwave timer knob.\n- move_to_microwave_temperature_knob: generate waypoints to move the robot arm end effector near the microwave temperature knob.\n- retrieve_the_mug_from_slidecabinet: generate waypoints to retrieve the mug from slidecabinet and put it on the table.\n\nHere is a list of available robot arm end effector closure degrees.It is used to determine the closure degree of the end effector when the robotic arm executes above primitives.\n- 0.0: End effector closure for robotic arm simple motions or when releasing an object.\n- 0.38: End effector closure for robotic arm when grasping a big object (like a mug) or carrying big object (like a mug) while moving.\n- 0.8: End effector closure for robotic arm when grasping a small object (like door handle or knob).\n\nYou should decide the primitive function name, waypoint_func_name and pinch_grasp, return the result in the following format:\n```primitive\n- primitive_func_name: some_primitive_function\n- waypoint_func_name: some_waypoint_function or None\n- gripper_closure: some_closure_degrees\n```\n\nThe APIs you can use for writing the reward function:\n- get_site_position(env_data, site_name): get the position of center of mass of object with site_name. Currently, site_name supports 'slidehandle_site', 'microhandle_site', 'micro_timer_knob_site' and 'micro_temperature_knob_site'. 'slidehandle_site' represents the center point of the sliding cabinet door handle. 'microhandle_site' represents the center point of the microwave door handle. 'micro_timer_knob_site' represents the center point of the microwave timer knob. 'micro_temperature_knob_site' represents the center point of the microwave temperature knob.Please choose the appropriate site_name based on the substep description.\n- get_joint_state(env_data, joint_name): get the joint angle value of a joint in an object.\n- get_joint_limit(env_model, joint_name): get the lower and upper joint angle limit of a joint in an object, returned as a 2-element tuple.\n- get_eef_pos_and_quat(env_data): returns the position, orientation of the robot end-effector as a 2-element tuple.\n\nThe action space you can use for learning with the reward: delta-translation is better suited for small movements, and normalized-direct-translation is better suited for directly specifying the target location of the robot end-effector. \nYou can assume that for objects, the joint value: 0 corresponds to their natural state, e.g., a box is closed with the lid joint being 0, and a lever is unpushed when the joint angle is 0.\nNote that, If the decomposed sub-steps include taking an object out of Container A and placing it into Container B or on table, **it can be assumed that the doors of A and B are already open**, allowing the robotic arm to directly grasp the object and place it into B, and close the door of B. For example, if moving a mug from the sliding cabinet to the microwave, the robot arm can directly grasp the mug and place it into microwave, and close microwave door.\nIn reward function, for opening door, we think 75 percent is enough, for closing door, we think 95 percent is enough, for rotating knob, we think 50 percent is enough\n**Please do not repeat the given configurations in you reply.

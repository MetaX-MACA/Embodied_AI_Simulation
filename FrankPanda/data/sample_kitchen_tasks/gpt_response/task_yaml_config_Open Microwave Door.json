        "\nI need you to describe the initial scene configuration for a given task in the following format, using a yaml file. This yaml file will help build the task in a simulator. The task is for a mobile Franka panda robotic arm to learn a manipulation skill in the simulator. The Franka panda arm is mounted on a table, at location (0, 0, 1.6). The z axis is the gravity axis. \n\nThe format is as follows:\n```yaml \n- use_table: whether the task requires using a table. This should be decided based on common sense. If a table is used, its location will be fixed at (0.5, -0.6, 0). The height of the table will be 1.6m. Usually, if the objects invovled in the task are usually placed on a table (not directly on the ground), then the task requires using a table.\n# for each object involved in the task, we need to specify the following fields for it.\n- type: mesh\n  name: name of the object, so it can be referred to in the simulator\n  lang: this should be a language description of the mesh. The language should be a concise description of the obejct, such that the language description can be used to search an existing database of objects to find the object.\n  center: the location of the object center. If there is a table in the task and the object needs to be placed on the table, this center should be in table coordinate range, where (0.6, 0.4, 1.6) is the left bottom corner of the table, and (0.9, 0.2, 1.6) is the right top corner of the table. In either case, you should try to specify a location such that there is no collision between objects. For slidecabinet, the center in yaml should be in the range of (0.82, 0.2, 2.3) and (0.82, -0.4, 2.3). For mug, the center in yaml should be in the slidecabinet's range, and has a coordinate offset (-0.22, 0.24, -0.159). For example, if the center of slidecabinet is (0.82 0.16 2.3), the center should be (0.6 0.4 2.141).\n  movable: if the object is movable or not in the simulator due to robot actions. This option should be falsed for most tasks; it should be true only if the task specifically requires the robot to move the object. \n```\n\nFor slidecabinet, the center in yaml should be in the range of (0.82, 0.2, 2.3) and (0.82, -0.6, 2.3). For mug, the center in yaml should be in the slidecabinet's range, and has a coordinate offset (-0.22, 0.24, -0.159). For example, if the center of slidecabinet is (0.82 0.16 2.3), the center should be (0.6 0.4 2.141).\n\nAn example input includes the task names, task descriptions, and objects involved in the task. I will also provide with you the articulation tree and semantics of the articulated object. \nThis can be useful for knowing what parts are already in the articulated object, and thus you do not need to repeat those parts as separate objects in the yaml file.\n\nYour task includes two parts:\n1. Output the yaml configuration of the task.\n2. Sometimes, the task description / objects involved will refer to generic/placeholder objects, e.g., to place an \"item\" into the drawer, and to heat \"food\" in the microwave. In the generated yaml config, you should change these placeholder objects to be concrete objects in the lang field, e.g., change \"item\" to be a toy or a pencil, and \"food\" to be a hamburger, a bowl of soup, etc. \n\nExample input:\nTask Name: Insert Bread Slice \nDescription: The robotic arm will insert a bread slice into the toaster.\nObjects involved: Toaster, bread slice. Only the objects specified here should be included in the yaml file.\n\n```Toaster articulation tree\nbodies: \nbase\nbody_0\nbody_1\nbody_2\nbody_3\nbody_4\nbody_5\n\njoints: \njoint_name: joint_0 joint_type: hinge parent_body: body_5 child_body: body_0\njoint_name: joint_1 joint_type: slide parent_body: body_5 child_body: body_1\njoint_name: joint_2 joint_type: slide parent_body: body_5 child_body: body_2\njoint_name: joint_3 joint_type: slide parent_body: body_5 child_body: body_3\njoint_name: joint_4 joint_type: slide parent_body: body_5 child_body: body_4\njoint_name: joint_5 joint_type: none parent_body: base child_body: body_5\n```\n\n```Toaster semantics\nbody_0 hinge knob\nbody_1 slide slider\nbody_2 slide button\nbody_3 slide button\nbody_4 slide button\nbody_5 hinge toaster_body\n```\n\n\nAn example output:\n```yaml\n- use_table: True ### Toaster and bread are usually put on a table. \n- type: mesh\n  name: \"Toaster\"\n  center: (0.9, 0.4, 1.6) # Remember that when an object is placed on the table, the center is expressed in the table coordinate range, where (0.6, 0.4, 1.6) is the left bottom corner and (0.9, 0.2, 1.6) is the right top corner of the table. Here we put the toaster near the right top corner of the table.  \n  lang: \"a common toaster\"\n  movable: False\n- type: mesh\n  name: \"bread slice\"\n  center: (0.6, 0.2, 1.6) # Remember that when an object is placed on the table, the center is expressed in the table coordinate range, where (0.6, 0.4, 1.6) is the left bottom corner and (0.9, 0.2, 1.6) is the right top corner of the table. Here we put the bread slice near the left corner of the table.  \n  lang: \"a slice of bread\"\n  movable: True\n```\n\nAnother example input:\nTask Name: Removing Lid From Pot\nDescription: The robotic arm will remove the lid from the pot.\nObjects involved: KitchenPot. Only the objects specified here should be included in the yaml file.\n\n```KitchenPot articulation tree\nbodies: \nbase\nbody_0\nbody_1\n\njoints: \njoint_name: joint_0 joint_type: slide parent_body: body_1 child_body: body_0\njoint_name: joint_1 joint_type: none parent_body: base child_body: body_1\n```\n\n```KitchenPot semantics\nbody_0 slider lid\nbody_1 free pot_body\n```\nOutput:\n```yaml\n- use_table: True # A kitchen pot is usually placed on the table.\n- type: mesh\n  name: \"KitchenPot\"\n  center: (0.6, 0.2, 1.6) # Remember that when an object is placed on the table, the center is expressed in the table coordinate range, where (0.6, 0.4, 1.6) is the left bottom corner and (0.9, 0.2, 1.6) is the right top corner of the table. Here we put the kitchen pot just at a random location on the table.  \n  lang: \"a common kitchen pot\"\n  movable: True\n```\nNote in this example, the kitchen pot already has a lid from the semantics file. Therefore, you do not need to include a separate lid in the yaml file.\n\nAnother example:\nTask Name: Put an item into the box drawer\nDescription: The robot will open the drawer of the box, and put an item into it.\nObjects involved: A box with drawer, an item to be placed in the drawer. \n\n```Box articulation tree\nbodies: \nbase\nbody_0\nbody_1\nbody_2\n\njoints: \njoint_name: joint_0 joint_type: hinge parent_body: body_2 child_body: body_0\njoint_name: joint_1 joint_type: slide parent_body: body_2 child_body: body_1\njoint_name: joint_2 joint_type: none parent_body: base child_body: body_2\n```\n\n```Box semantics\nbody_0 hinge rotation_lid\nbody_1 slide drawer\nbody_2 free box_body\n```\n\nOutput:\n```yaml\n-   use_table: true\n-   center: (0.8, 0.2, 1.6)\n    lang: \"a wooden box\"\n    name: \"Box\"\n    type: mesh\n    movable: False\n-   center: (0.6, 0.4, 1.6)\n    lang: \"A toy\" # Note here, we changed the generic/placeholder \"item\" object to be a more concrete object: a toy. \n    name: \"Item\"\n    type: mesh\n    movable: True\n```\n\nRules: \n- You do not need to include the robot in the yaml file.\n- The yaml file should only include the objects listed in \"Objects involved\".\n- Sometimes, the task description / objects involved will refer to generic/placeholder objects, e.g., to place an \"item\" into the drawer, and to heat \"food\" in the microwave. In the generated yaml config, you should change these placeholder objects to be concrete objects in the lang field, e.g., change \"item\" to be a toy or a pencil, and \"food\" to be a hamburger, a bowl of soup, etc. \n- Do not to create multiple configurations for a object in yaml. For example, for a mug object, you should not create mug1, mug2 in yaml.\n\n\nCan you do this for the following task:\nTask Name: Open Microwave Door\nDescription: The robotic arm will open the microwave door\nObjects involved: microwave, slidecabinet, mug\n\n```microwave articulation tree \nbodies:\nmicroroot\nmicrodoorroot\nmicro_timer_knob\nmicro_temperature_knob\n\njoints: \njoint_name: microdoorroot_joint joint_type: hinge parent_body: microroot child_body: microdoorroot\njoint_name: micro_timer_joint joint_type: hinge parent_body: microroot child_body: micro_timer_knob\njoint_name: micro_temperature_joint joint_type: hinge parent_body: microroot child_body: micro_temperature_knob \n```\n\n```microwave semantics \nmicroroot heavy microwave_body\nmicrodoorroot hinge door\nmicro_timer_knob hinge timer_knob\nmicro_temperature_knob hinge temperature_knob \n```\n\n```slidecabinet articulation tree \nbodies:\nslide\nslidedoor\n\njoints: \njoint_name: slidedoor_joint joint_type: slide parent_body: slide child_body: slidedoor \n```\n\n```slidecabinet semantics \nslide heavy slidecabinet_body\nslidedoor slide door \n```\n\n```mug articulation tree \nbodies:\nmug_base\n\n\njoints: \nNone \n```\n\n```mug semantics \nmug_base heavy mug_body \n```\n"
